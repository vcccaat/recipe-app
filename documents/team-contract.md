# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a _living_ document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name.
   Super-sonia

2. To what goals do we all commit?

   We are all committed to build up and deliver our project in consistently high quality and in a timely fashion.

   We are all committed to learn and develop our technical skills as well as personal skills throughout building the project.

   We are all committed to contribute equally to this project.

3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

   Team members will have their assigned work done by the deadline and to the best of their ability.

   Team members agree to treat one another with respect and encourage a diversity of opinions.

   Team member will keep others informed if he or she encounters any issues regarding the project.

   Team members will attend each group meeting on time. 
	 
   Team members will take responsibility for the success of the project. 


4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

   We have regular communication on Wechat and weekly team meeting via Zoom.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

   Project Manager: coordinate with the teammates and professors' assignment requirements. Manage the timeline and team communication.

   Product Manager: come up with product requirements and cooperate with the team to turn those concepts into actual products following the Scrum framework.
   
   UX Researcher: research about what our competitors are doing and their advantages and disadvantages are. Research about how to stay competitive in this area in terms of our UX design.

   UX Designer: draw wireframes about our design and cooperate with the programmers to achieve them.

   Software Engineer: Write front end components and deploy the web app.

   Each of us we take on many roles to develop our skills in planning, design and programming.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

   We will need everyone in the team to be responsible for his/her own task and we are open to discuss the assignment according to every team member’s role in the team and skill levels.

   We will have deadlines for each task that every team member agrees on.

   If there’s any issue related to the task including failure of delivery/ passing the deadline/ no status reporting, we will reach out to the team member who is responsible for that task personally or have a team meeting to discuss what to do next to solve the problem. We will have to report it to the professor and the client if we can not come up with a solution for the problem.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

   We will need to make sure the tasks that every team member has been actively accepted and no one has issues on accomplishing their work when distributing the tasks. If there’s a conflict on work assignments, we can have a meeting or discuss it through chat to discuss it together or ask other team members to help.

   If there’s a conflict of different opinions on design, we will have a team meeting to discuss it, and the people who share different opinions need to let everyone know their reason like the advantage of their design, and show us what they have done. And we will analyze each option together until we discuss which one to use.

   Make sure we don’t hurt anyone’s feelings during the project and always be nice to each other.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

   If any member of the team comes up with different thoughts about the contract, we will first bring it up on the group chat and then make a team meeting if necessary to discuss the revision.

   Any revision on the team contract needs to be approved by all team members. Any details related to the change need to be known by every team member as well.

   We will update the revisioned contract and keep the old version for reference. We will also let the professor and client know about it if it’s necessary.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a _fun_ clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

	This contract is for us to cooperate better and deliver good results.
	Let's celebrate our achievements at the end of the project!
