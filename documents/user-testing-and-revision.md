### Participants 5: Male 

Assume you are a lawyer who enjoys cooking in his own place but he has a tight time schedule this semester. He has a meeting scheduled at 8 pm, and he would like to make a quick dinner using some available ingredients so that he can save his time.  
Now, you are trying to figure out how to play and learn in the app. (Onboarding tutorial experience) During the exploration, you can continue thinking out loud — that is, simply verbalizing your thoughts as they move through the user interface. Now you can start to explore the app. 

Notes:
The user does not know that he can click the "Confirm" or "Clear" button. The first reason is that the recipe lists get changed when the user drags the recipe, so the user does not know that he needs to click the "Confirm" button so that the selected ingredients are applied to the search function. The second reason is that the "Clear" and "Confirm" buttons do not stand out and the users need to scroll down to see these two buttons.

Follow-Up Questions
How would you rate the overall experience from 1 to 10? What do you like about it? What do you dislike about it?  
6. I think the app recommends recipes that can save my time.

Notes:
The user would like to see how many people have rated a specific recipe because he thinks that even if the rating is high, the rating does not tell much if there aren't many people participating in the rating.
