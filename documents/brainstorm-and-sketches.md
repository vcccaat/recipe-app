These are the sketches of UI that each team member proposed based on user research. For example, user would like to make meal in a short period of time can use a slider to select the approximate time of the meal. Each recipe card can display the recipe name and average time take to cook, so user can have a good idea of how much time allocate to prepare this meal.

User can leave comments on each recipe and this provide incentive for other users to upload high quality recipe.
