Yes, since I’d like to try new things all the time. I’ll get bored of the same things all day or repeat too many times. I want to search for new methods and tastes. That’s matters a lot. But at the same time, I want to make sure that the food is delicious. So I will learn from others online. That would be the time that I check the existed recipes.

- Do you use recipes to help you cook?

## Interview III

- Introductory questions
 
- What is your age?
 
21
 
- How often do you cook?
 
Frequently, about 5-6 days a week.
 
- How much time do you spend on cooking each week?
 
Not too sure, either have enough time, or very limited time.
 
- Do you cook based on your knowledge or based on something new you learned?
 
knowledge mostly
 
- How do you learn to cook?
 
Recipe application, or some social applications
 
- How do you define your ability in cooking? Novice, intermediate, or excellent?
 
intermediate, kinda experienced
 
- (If comfortable) What is your relationship status (e.g., single, married, etc.)?
 
In a relationship
 
- Deep Dive Questions
 
- Do you like to explore new recipes? Why?
 
Yes, it would be too boring if I just repeat what I know everyday, so I try new recipes occasionally and I find it super fun if I make it good. Also some posts of the dishes are super attractive on the applications so that makes me want to try it, especially when the comments said it's easy to make and tastes good!
 
- Do you use recipes to help you cook?
 
Yes, that’s the main tool I use for cooking and that helped a lot in developing my skills on cooking.
 
- Have you used any recipe apps? Do you like them? Why?
 
Yes, there are a lot of professional apps and they tell you nearly everything you need for cooking. 
 
- Can you recall the last time that you used the recipe? Can you mimic the situation? Thank you!
 
First I would just go through the contents and try to remember the key points. Then I would follow every step when cooking (and yes sometimes it’s hard to switch off your hands because it’s too oily to touch the phone but I have to) and try not to make mistakes. Also I have to use my knowledge to judge the dosage of the sauce and seasonings because the description is often not very clear for them. And then just follow the steps, it’s also kinda important to control the whole process based on your experience because ingredients and the cooker you used can not be exactly the same from the recipe applications.

- Introductory questions
 
- What is your age?
 
21
 
- How often do you cook?
 
About 1 time per 2 days when I regularly cook.

- Deep Dive Questions
 
- Do you like to explore new recipes? Why?
 
Not really because I’m not so good at cooking and I don’t have much time, and I try it sometimes. I would like to practice on some dishes that I already know if they taste good and sometimes I would like to just make some minor modifications to see if they could be improved. And I would try some new recipe if my friend tells me it’s easy and good.
 
- Do you use recipes to help you cook?
 
Ofc that’s how I cook.
 
- Have you used any recipe apps? Do you like them? Why?

- Can you recall the last time that you used the recipe? Can you mimic the situation? Thank you!
 
Yeah I was going to make a chicken and potato stir fry and I got all the ingredients from the supermarket. When I opened the recipe I realized that it takes like half an hour to marinate the chicken but I was super hungry so I just made it like 10 minutes maybe. And I’m not sure about the ratio of chicken and potatoes. I followed all the instruction like when I cook my eyes were switching from the wok and the phone again and again… Luckily the meal taste good, one more thing is that I was going to utilize the ingredients left but I have no idea how to do that, if I could just put the ingredients I left on the fridge to the app and it would provide me of some recipes made of them that would be more than great.
