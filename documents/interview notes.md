1. Interviewee Mr. Liang is a 23-year-old graduate student at Cornell University. He cooks 4~5 times per week. He spends about 5 hours per week on cooking. He cooks based both on his knowledge and something new he learned online (not necessarily from recipe apps). He enjoys making cakes and would like to learn recipes online for cakes. He does not care about how much time he spends on making cakes, but for recipes other than those for cakes, he wants them to be time-saving. He enjoys searching for cake recipes that both look nice and taste delicious. He will carefully read the recipe and see if it seems delicious to him or not. He will only follow the recipes with great reviews. He doesn’t check the recipe when he is cooking because he does not think it is convinient. He thinks that even if he uses the recipe, he may still fail to make cakes because sometimes it is hard to control the amount of ingredients he puts. 

2. Interviewee Mr. Li is a 19-year-old undergraduate student at UCSD. He spends 15 hours a week in cooking. He looks at recipes not only when he is cooking, but also he looks at them when he is free. He looks at what he has in the refridgerator then decide what he will cook. He does not use a specific recipe app. Instead, he likes to watch videos on YouTube about how to cook something. He watches those videos for fun. He prefers to watch long videos (like those on youtube) than short videos (like those on Tiktok) for recipes. Although he is a big fan of Youtube, he says that Youtube is not a perfect place for learning new recipes because he needs to do the search on his own. He will not review the videos when cooking because he thinks that it's not convenient. He prefers those recipe videos on youtube that are concrete and clear about each step. He also like to look at visualized recipes. He will read the recipes for many times before he starts cooking. He will avoid looking at the recipe again and again when he is cooking, but will check it again if he needs. On Sundays, he may cook a great amount of food for the next week to save time.

Yes, since I’d like to try new things all the time. I’ll get bored of the same things all day or repeat too many times. I want to search for new methods and tastes. That’s matters a lot. But at the same time, I want to make sure that the food is delicious. So I will learn from others online. That would be the time that I check the existed recipes.

Sometimes in my spare time, or I will have ingredients make try new things

If the ing is fresh or unfamiliar

  
  

-   Do you use recipes to help you cook?
    

If it is the first time, I'll cook according to the recipe all the way. If I cooked before, I’ll look through the recipe before cooking.

First, search google and open several of them. Choose a good one with a great pic and a reliable website. Check while cooking. Check 10 times during the cooking. While preparing and fire preparing and time cooked. Also in the waiting time, I will reassure the time and further steps.

The recipe is great but finding it is not that useful. Want pt find a reliable recipe. Google & youtube &bilibili & red

-   Have you used any recipe apps? Do you like them? Why?
    

Red: the favorite one since it is reliable and contains comments and likeness of each recipe. Compared with video, it is more straightforward in considering the text information.

Video is more for fun. Without the time limit, you can see the visual things of each step

But the speed is different

You have to look back at the video to see the information multiple times.

  

-   Can you recall the last time that you used the recipe? Can you mimic the situation? Thank you!
    

I’ll first try to recall what ingredients do I have at home. But I always fail. I’ll start by thinking about what kind of meat do I have. And then thinking about what kind of food can I make by these ingredients. Then I will walk in front of the frig. Look at the meat first to ensure my thoughts. Then I’ll start to cook. For the dish that I tried once but not really familiar with. I will check the recipe that i used before. Therefore, it won’t take much time. However, if there is a brand new dish. I will go through several recipe and find the greatest one. The criteria of the recipe includes several aspects. The first one is the picture of the recipes. I will choose a more personal one stead of commercial one. In these filter information, I will choose the prettiest one or the one that matched the imaginatioln in mind. Then I will look through the recipe to see whether I have all the ingredients. If I don’t, i will choose a new recipe or a new dish. Then I will take a glance of these comments below to see the reliability of the recipe. But I won;t do it if the time is limited. Then I’ll start to cook. I will bring all the ingredients from the firg to the table. Then i will check the recipe whether I miss anything or not. And how should I deal with these ingredients. I might check several time. Bad memorization…. Then I will start to cook. I will check the recipe at the beginning of each step and end of each step. During the waiting time as well to strengthen I need to check the recipe 10 times or more.

I hate the experience that I am busy with another thing with/without another hand, I have to clean my hands first or stop what I’m currently doing. Also to put the phone in a safe place is another consideration.

  

What do you like about the current method?Dislike?

Informative but need to be filtered
