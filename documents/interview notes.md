Yes, since I’d like to try new things all the time. I’ll get bored of the same things all day or repeat too many times. I want to search for new methods and tastes. That’s matters a lot. But at the same time, I want to make sure that the food is delicious. So I will learn from others online. That would be the time that I check the existed recipes.

Sometimes in my spare time, or I will have ingredients make try new things

If the ing is fresh or unfamiliar

  
  

-   Do you use recipes to help you cook?
    

If it is the first time, I'll cook according to the recipe all the way. If I cooked before, I’ll look through the recipe before cooking.

First, search google and open several of them. Choose a good one with a great pic and a reliable website. Check while cooking. Check 10 times during the cooking. While preparing and fire preparing and time cooked. Also in the waiting time, I will reassure the time and further steps.

The recipe is great but finding it is not that useful. Want pt find a reliable recipe. Google & youtube &bilibili & red

-   Have you used any recipe apps? Do you like them? Why?
    

Red: the favorite one since it is reliable and contains comments and likeness of each recipe. Compared with video, it is more straightforward in considering the text information.

Video is more for fun. Without the time limit, you can see the visual things of each step

But the speed is different

You have to look back at the video to see the information multiple times.

  

-   Can you recall the last time that you used the recipe? Can you mimic the situation? Thank you!
    

I’ll first try to recall what ingredients do I have at home. But I always fail. I’ll start by thinking about what kind of meat do I have. And then thinking about what kind of food can I make by these ingredients. Then I will walk in front of the frig. Look at the meat first to ensure my thoughts. Then I’ll start to cook. For the dish that I tried once but not really familiar with. I will check the recipe that i used before. Therefore, it won’t take much time. However, if there is a brand new dish. I will go through several recipe and find the greatest one. The criteria of the recipe includes several aspects. The first one is the picture of the recipes. I will choose a more personal one stead of commercial one. In these filter information, I will choose the prettiest one or the one that matched the imaginatioln in mind. Then I will look through the recipe to see whether I have all the ingredients. If I don’t, i will choose a new recipe or a new dish. Then I will take a glance of these comments below to see the reliability of the recipe. But I won;t do it if the time is limited. Then I’ll start to cook. I will bring all the ingredients from the firg to the table. Then i will check the recipe whether I miss anything or not. And how should I deal with these ingredients. I might check several time. Bad memorization…. Then I will start to cook. I will check the recipe at the beginning of each step and end of each step. During the waiting time as well to strengthen I need to check the recipe 10 times or more.

I hate the experience that I am busy with another thing with/without another hand, I have to clean my hands first or stop what I’m currently doing. Also to put the phone in a safe place is another consideration.

  

What do you like about the current method?Dislike?

Informative but need to be filtered
