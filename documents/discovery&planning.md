## Users of the Product

Our users are people who need assistance “finding recipes”


## Gathering Information


### - Methodologies:

We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews and 6 field studies with several follow-up questions. According to our field studies as well as part of the semi-structured interviews, we conducted an affinity diagram accordingly.

### - Users interviewed:

(Jieyu)
1. Interviewee Mr. Liang is a 23-year-old graduate student at Cornell University. He cooks 4~5 times per week. He spends about 5 hours per week on cooking. He cooks based both on his knowledge and something new he learned online (not necessarily from recipe apps). He wants to keep the carbonhydrate low in his diet because he doesn’t want to gain weight. He likes to make cakes but he doesn't necessarily eat all of them because he wants to keep his weight off. He is of intermediate level in making cakes. He enjoys making cakes and would like to learn recipes online for cakes.

2. Interviewee Mr. Li is a 19-year-old undergraduate student at UCSD. He spends 15 hours a week in cooking. He is a graduate student. He looks at recipes not only when he is cooking, but also he looks at them when he is free. He does not use a specific recipe app. Instead, he likes to watch videos on YouTube about how to cook something. He watches those videos for fun. He will not review the videos when cooking because he thinks that it's not convenient.
