## Users of the Product

Our users are people with limited time for cooking and need help on dealing with the ingredients left in their fridge, like college students and office workers that are busy working/studying or have tight schedules, to help them make food fast and easy.

## Gathering Information

### - Methodologies:

We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews and seven contextual interviews with several follow-up questions. According to our contextual interview and part of the semi-structured interviews, we showed an affinity diagram accordingly. We chose the seven users from the 15 semi-structured interviews. We continued to do the contextual interview with those willing to participate in the field studies and who have used the recipe needs. We asked them several questions in the contextual interviews and simulated how they would typically interact with the recipe at their home.

Semi-structured interviews can enable us to find a significant number of insights in a short period of time. At the same time, they allow the interviewees to give open-ended responses to gain more in-depth information. After refining the goal, using contextual interviews enables us to gain focused insights. They enable us to observe the details about the interaction between participants and the target objects. And since participants would be in a familiar environment, they tend to relax and be authentic. Also, in-depth questions enable us to gain real insights.

### - Users interviewed:

1. Miss. Cao is a 21-year-old undergrad student at Cornell University, she lives in the students' dorm and cooks occasionally. Also, she is at an intermediate level on cooking so she checks recipes a lot (by using recipe application). As a student, she is kind of busy with school work and doesn't have much spare time on cooking so she really wants to cook fast but also wants the food to taste good. She wants some more convenient cooking methods because she doesn't have an oven in her dorm. Plus, she is not an experienced cook and it's hard for her to catch the instruction of the recipe sometimes so she wonders there's some sort of instructions that can lead her for the whole process, just like the videos that teach people doing the exercise, we can follow it for the whole process.
   Main findings: interviewees tend to find a recipe that is quick and easy when time is limited. The interviewee prefers a visual demonstration of the step-by-step cooking process.

2. Miss. Chen is a 21 years old student at PSU and she cooks frequently about 4-5 days a week, she is an experienced cook and has been cooking for 4 years, she also uses recipes (recipe application) very often because she likes to explorer new dishes. One thing that concerns her is how to deal with the ingredients left after each meal because she wants to utilize them but she doesn't know how to cook only using those ingredients. She also mentioned that she has the need to finish the meal fast or in a specific time period because sometimes she has limited time for cooking. Plus, she has the desire to keep her body weight so she wants to know the calories or some more nutrient information of the ingredients. Another issue she talked about is about switching hands while cooking using recipe applications because when she has done a part of the instruction, she needs to switch to her phone and see what's the next step in a hurry. Her hands always made the phone dirty and oily during the process and made her feel uncomfortable.
   Main findings: interviewee likes to use recipe applications to explore new dishes. The interviewee tends to find a recipe that is quick and easy when time is limited. Interviewees don't like to interact with the mobile app too often with their hands during cooking.

3. Interviewee Mr. Liang is a 23-year-old graduate student at Cornell University. He cooks 4~5 times per week. He spends about 5 hours per week cooking. He cooks based both on his knowledge and something new he learned online (not necessarily from recipe apps). He enjoys making cakes and would like to learn recipes online for cakes. He does not care about how much time he spends on making cakes, but for recipes other than those for cakes, he wants them to be time-saving. He enjoys searching for cake recipes that both look nice and taste delicious. He will carefully read the recipe and see if it seems delicious to him or not. He will only follow the recipes with great reviews. He doesn’t check the recipe when he is cooking because he does not think it is convenient. He thinks that even if he uses the recipe, he may still fail to make cakes because sometimes it is hard to control the number of ingredients he puts.
   Main findings: Interviewees use recipe app to learn to make desserts. The interviewee tends to find a recipe that is quick and easy when time is limited. the interviewee will look at the recipe review section to determine if a recipe is worth trying. The interviewee prefers to know the exact dosage of the seasonings or sauces rather than 'a little or 'proper amount'.

4. Interviewee Mr. Li is a 19-year-old undergraduate student at UCSD. He spends 15 hours a week cooking. He looks at recipes not only when he is cooking, but also he looks at them when he is free. He looks at what he has in the refrigerator then decides what he will cook. He does not use a specific recipe app. Instead, he likes to watch videos on YouTube about how to cook something. He watches those videos for fun. He prefers to watch long videos (like those on youtube) than short videos (like those on Tiktok) for recipes. Although he is a big fan of Youtube, he says that Youtube is not a perfect place for learning new recipes because he needs to search on his own. He will not review the videos when cooking because he thinks that it's not convenient. He prefers those recipe videos on youtube that are concrete and clear about each step. He also likes to look at visualized recipes. He will read the recipes many times before he starts cooking. He will avoid looking at the recipe again and again when he is cooking but will check it again if he needs to. On Sundays, he may cook a great amount of food for the next week to save time.
   Main findings: Interviewees prefer to watch a lively video or use a recipe with more visual content. Interviewees don't like to check their devices multiple times during cooking. the interviewee might cook excessive food to eat in separate meals to save time.

5. Mr. Fan is a 22 yrs old master student at Cornell University, he lives alone in an apartment and usually cooks 6- 7 times a week. He admits he is not good at cooking and he has to rely on a recipe to prepare a meal. He loves to spend sparse time watching short videos, so as he prefers having visual presentations on the cooking procedure, e.g. short cooking videos, photos, etc. He usually spends less than 15min preparing a meal, most of the cases are cooking some pre-made instant food. He has a strong desire to find some simple and tasty recipes that are tailored for students or working-class who don't want to spend too much time on cooking but still want to remain healthy.

Most of the time he cooks based on his knowledge. Recently he is preparing for his daughter's birthday and would like to learn something new using online recipes. He used the app Chunky Chef. He found it useful and thorough but took too much time to read. He also wants to save money and would like to directly input what ingredients he has got in his fridge.
   Main findings: interviewee wants to save money by utilizing what he already has in his fridge instead of buying something new.

8. Miss. Olivia is a 24 years old UX Researcher and has worked for 2 years. She spends about 5 hours a week cooking and she thinks she is at an intermediate level. She usually prepares the food 1 day prior to working and she tends to cook easy and low-calorie food. She is willing to discover new recipes but she tends to investigate more on the recipes about how other peoples think so she would like to know how other people like the recipe. Also, she is a bit tired of the recipe applications nowadays with too many unnecessary features and buttons that cost her extra time to check what she really needs, she just wants it simple and works fast. 
   Main findings: interviewee wants to know more about how other people think about the recipes online and wants a simple and easy-to-use application without too many unnecessary features and buttons.

## Scenarios (11.16 revision)

Jason is a lawyer who enjoys cooking in his own place but he has a tight time schedule. He has a meeting scheduled at 8 pm, and he would like to make a quick dinner using some available ingredients so that he can save his time. Jason goes to our Facipe app for the first time today and is awarded one point. This motivates him to come to Facipe again tomorrow. Jason has 15 minutes before going to work and he has got chicken, beef, tomato, and egg in his refrigerator. He clicks the “Confirm” button and can see three recipes out there. He can see four recipes that satisfy his needs. They are Burger, Pasta with Tomato Sauce, Creamy Tomato Soup, and Omelets. He picks Omelet because it seems the most convenient one. Jason can also type in the search input field if he has something in mind. For example, Jason can type “Omelet” and the filter is applied. Jason clicks the recipe card and is redirected to the recipe details page. He sees the detailed steps with nice pictures and follows them to make a delicious meal. Our Facipe app helps Jason save time.

Amy is a double-majored student at Cornell University and she is super busy on weekdays. She cooks nearly every day and she loves to share her dishes. Yesterday she just used up most of the major ingredients and she woke up a bit late today so she doesn't have time to prepare food but just using the stuff left in her fridge. She doesn't have time to open her laptop so she opens up Facipe app on her phone (it's a responsive application so it fully supports mobile devices). She slides the time bar to 15 minutes and 1 person to serve and selected what she has in her fridge: beef, onion, and potatoes. She can see several recipes and she chooses the beef burger. After she followed the instructions and finished the recipe, she feels the burger is easy to cook and taste really good so she taps the share button and leaves a comment with a photo of what she made, she can even earn a reward by sharing the comment with pictures.
