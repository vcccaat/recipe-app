## Users of the Product

Our users are people who need assistance “finding recipes”


## Gathering Information


### - Methodologies:

We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews and 6 field studies with several follow-up questions. According to our field studies as well as part of the semi-structured interviews, we conducted an affinity diagram accordingly.

### - Users interviewed:

1. Miss. Cao is a 21 yrs old undergrad student at Cornell University, she lives in the students' dorm and cooks occasionally. Also, she is at an intermediate level on cooking so she checks recipes a lot. As a student, she is kind of busy with school and doesn't have much spare time on cooking so she really wants to cook fast but also taste good, maybe also with a more convenient cooking method because she doesn't have an oven in her dorm. Plus, she is not an experienced cook and it's hard for her to catch the instruction of the recipe sometimes so she wonders there's some sort of instructions that can lead her for the whole process. 

2. Miss. Chen is a 21 years old student at PSU and she cooks frequently about 4-5 days a week, she is an experienced cook and has been cooking for 4 years, she also uses recipes very often because she likes to explorer new dishes. One thing that concerns her is how to deal with the ingredients left after each meal because she wants to utilize them but she doesn't know how to cook only using those ingredients. She also mentioned that she has the need to finish the meal fast or in a specific time period because sometimes she has limited time for cooking. Plus, she has the desire to keep the body weight so she want to know the calories or some more nutrient information of the ingredients.

### - Key takeaways:

(Sonia)
- People desire for finding a recipe based on existing ingredients

- People tend to find a recipe that is quick and easy when time is limited

- People tend to check their devices (mostly mobile phones) multiple times and desire for keeping the phone safe and clean

- People prefer step-by-step instruction with visual presentations
