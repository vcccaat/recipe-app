## Gathering Information

### - Methodologies:

We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews and six contextual interviews with several follow-up questions. According to our contextual interview and part of the semi-structured interviews, we showed an affinity diagram accordingly. We choose the six users from the 15 semi-structured interviews. We continue to do the contextual interview with those willing to participate in the field studies and who have used the recipe needs.  We asked them several questions in the contextual interviews and simulated how they would typically interact with the recipe at their home.

Semi-structured interviews could enable us to find a significant number of insights in a short period. At the same time, it allows the interviewee to give open-ended responses to gain more in-depth information. After refining the goal, using contextual interviews enables us to gain focused insights. It let us observe the details about the interaction between participants and the target objects. And since participants would be in a familiar environment, they tend to relax and be authentic. Also, in-depth questions enable us to gain real insights.

### - Users interviewed:

1. Miss. Cao is a 21 yrs old undergrad student at Cornell University, she lives in the students' dorm and cooks occasionally. Also, she is at an intermediate level on cooking so she checks recipes a lot (by using recipe application). As a student, she is kind of busy with school and doesn't have much spare time on cooking so she really wants to cook fast but also taste good, also with some more convenient cooking methods because she doesn't have an oven in her dorm. Plus, she is not an experienced cook and it's hard for her to catch the instruction of the recipe sometimes so she wonders there's some sort of instructions that can lead her for the whole process, just like the videos that teaching people doing the exercise, we can follow it for the whole process.
Main findings: interviewee tends to find a recipe that is quick and easy when time is limited. interviewee prefers a visual demonstration of the step-by-step cooking process.

2. Miss. Chen is a 21 years old student at PSU and she cooks frequently about 4-5 days a week, she is an experienced cook and has been cooking for 4 years, she also uses recipes (recipe application) very often because she likes to explorer new dishes. One thing that concerns her is how to deal with the ingredients left after each meal because she wants to utilize them but she doesn't know how to cook only using those ingredients. She also mentioned that she has the need to finish the meal fast or in a specific time period because sometimes she has limited time for cooking. Plus, she has the desire to keep her body weight so she wants to know the calories or some more nutrient information of the ingredients. Another issue she talked about is about switching hands while cooking using recipe applications because when she has done a part of the instruction, she needs to switch to her phone and see what's the next step in a hurry. Her hands always made the phone dirty and oily during the process and made her feel uncomfortable.

He cooks based both on his knowledge and something new he learned online (not necessarily from recipe apps). He enjoys making cakes and would like to learn recipes online for cakes. He does not care about how much time he spends on making cakes, but for recipes other than those for cakes, he wants them to be time-saving. He enjoys searching for cake recipes that both look nice and taste delicious. He will carefully read the recipe and see if it seems delicious to him or not. He will only follow the recipes with great reviews. He doesn’t check the recipe when he is cooking because he does not think it is convinient. He thinks that even if he uses the recipe, he may still fail to make cakes because sometimes it is hard to control the amount of ingredients he puts.

He watches those videos for fun. He prefers to watch long videos (like those on youtube) than short videos (like those on Tiktok) for recipes. Although he is a big fan of Youtube, he says that Youtube is not a perfect place for learning new recipes because he needs to do the search on his own. He will not review the videos when cooking because he thinks that it's not convenient. He prefers those recipe videos on youtube that are concrete and clear about each step. He also like to look at visualized recipes. He will read the recipes for many times before he starts cooking. He will avoid looking at the recipe again and again when he is cooking, but will check it again if he needs. On Sundays, he may cook a great amount of food for the next week to save time.
