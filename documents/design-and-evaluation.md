## Brainstorming Note

## Revisions to Prior Work
We made some changes on the discovery-and-planning.md of our milestone 2 submission based on the instructor's feedback, below outlined all changes to our prior work.

### 1. Who are your users? 
Feedback: You have a good start here. However, based on the users you interviewed (which on their problems and needs, you based your app's focus), the target user description is too broad and should be more specific and aligned with the user group you focused on. According to that description, you should have interviewed users from different age groups, at different locations and cultures, with various professions and careers, etc. 

Revision: Our users are people with limited time for cooking and need help on dealing with the ingredients left in their frige, like college students and officer workers that are busing on working / studying or have tight schedules, to help them make food easier and faster.

### 2. Interview - What methods you used and why the methods are good choices
Feedback: you didn't explain why you chose to conduct field studies with six users. Did you do them before the semi-structured interviews? Where did they take place? What was the procedure of the field study?

Revision: We noticed that our methodologies are semi-structured interviews and contextual studies. Since our contextual interview has a session to let people stimulate how they interact with recipes, we design them as field strides. We add the procedure and how we decide the six contextual interviews in the new version.

### 3. Interview - Provide a brief summary of each user and what you learned from them.
Feedback: you only did partial work here. You indicated you conducted 15 interviews, you included a summary of only six of them, what about the rest? What about the main findings from the six field studies?

Revision:  we add main findinds under the user interview section for each of the six field studies.

### 4. Problem identification
Feedback: you didn't indicated which one or two key problems you are planning on focusing on.

Revision:

- **It's hard to find the recipe that exactly match the ingredients that the user wants. (The problem we are planning on focusing on)**

- **It's hard to find recipes that can be finished within a desired time period. (The problem we are planning on focusing on)**

- Users don't know the health information (like calories, nutrient content, etc.) of the recipe.

- Users don't want to check their devices multiple times when they are cooking.

- Some recipes don't have clear instructions on the dosage needed for the seasoning / sauce.

- Recipes can't be visually presented in a step-by-step way.

- Bad recipes may hurt the users' experience.


### 5. Value Propositions
Feedback: Only one value proposition? You could have come up with a few more.

Revision: 

### 6. Scenarios
Feedback: your scenarios should describe the user while he/she performed the task (not just what task he plans to do). Also, it is good to include a description of what happens after the user performs the task, how do they feel, what are their thoughts.

Revision: added description of how user performs the task as well as his/her thoughts on this app.
