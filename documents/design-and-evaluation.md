## Revisions to Prior Work
We made some changes on the discovery-and-planning.md of our milestone 2 submission based on the instructor's feedback, below outlined all changes to our prior work.

### 1. Who are your users? 
Feedback: You have a good start here. However, based on the users you interviewed (which on their problems and needs, you based your app's focus), the target user description is too broad and should be more specific and aligned with the user group you focused on. According to that description, you should have interviewed users from different age groups, at different locations and cultures, with various professions and careers, etc. 

Revision: 

### 2. Interview - What methods you used and why the methods are good choices
Feedback: you didn't explain why you chose to conduct field studies with six users. Did you do them before the semi-structured interviews? Where did they take place? What was the procedure of the field study?

Revision:

### 3. Interview - Provide a brief summary of each user and what you learned from them.
Feedback: you only did partial work here. You indicated you conducted 15 interviews, you included a summary of only six of them, what about the rest? What about the main findings from the six field studies?

Revision:

### 4. Problem identification
Feedback: you didn't indicated which one or two key problems you are planning on focusing on.

Revision:

### 5. Value Propositions
Feedback: Only one value proposition? You could have come up with a few more.

Revision: 

### 6. Scenarios
Feedback: your scenarios should describe the user while he/she performed the task (not just what task he plans to do). Also, it is good to include a description of what happens after the user performs the task, how do they feel, what are their thoughts.

Revision: added description of how user performs the task as well as his/her thoughts on this app.
