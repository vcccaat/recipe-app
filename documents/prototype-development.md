# Milestone 4: High-Fidelity Prototype

## Revisions to Prior Work
Increased mock data to 10 recipes
Improved responsive display for filter panel and card component in the main page
The trending button in our original design is not related to our user scenario which is to make quick and easy meal, so we removed this feature
- Rewarded users cash points for their first login of a day, and reward points for posting recipe feedback, display the total reward points in the top-right corner of the header bar. These adjustments are our persuasive design that aim to increase user incentive to interact with the app more often.
