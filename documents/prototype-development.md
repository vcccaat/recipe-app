## Revisions to Prior Work

- Feedback from milestone 3 are incorporated in the design.md, including adding design details on each feature, and the rationale behind.
- Added captions for sketches and complement brainstorm note.
- Increased mock data to 10 recipes.
- Improved responsive display for filter panel and card component in the main page.
- The trending button in our original design is not related to our user scenario which is to make quick and easy meal, so we removed this feature.
- Rewarded users cash points for their first login of a day, and reward points for posting recipe feedback, display the total reward points in the top-right corner of the header bar. These adjustments are our persuasive design that aim to increase user incentive to interact with the app more often.
